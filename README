The title of our game is Space Combat.
It a space-themed player versus boss battle game; our inspiration was a cross of a Halo-theme with Dark Souls mechanics.
Our names are Marcus Hayes and Brian Restrepo.
In our project, we used if-then statements for movement and functions for performing complex actions.
When we began our game, we had to learn everything except for our basic 110 concepts, such as using tickers, visualizing graphics, using graph-translations to make movements, and using the modulo operator as a means for spacing out damage cycles.

Brian built most of the code framework and visualized the graphics. Marcus created the player and boss movement, the player and boss interactions (damage, primarily), and the attacks that the boss uses.
We were able to reach our goal of three boss attacks and semi-realistic gravity, both of which ultimately took the most amount of time to complete and polish.
In the future, we would like to add an actual level on top of the boss fight, as well as more complex movement and movesets for the player.
